## Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

* **Assess Sales Team Performance.** How is each sales team performing in comparison to others? Identifying the top-performing teams and those that may need improvement.

* **Evaluate Sales Agent Productivity.** Are any sales agents significantly lagging behind? Determining which agents are underperforming and may require additional support or training.

* **Identify Trends.** Can any quarter-over-quarter trends be observed? Understanding patterns in sales performance.

* **Analyze Product Success Rates.** Do any products have better win rates than others? Investigating which products are more successful in closing deals.

A personal objective of this project was to strengthen my ability to write more complex SQL queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions. Additionally, I aimed to deepen my skills in creating advanced DAX measures and building dynamic dashboards in Power BI.
